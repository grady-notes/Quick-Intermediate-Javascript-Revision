# Introduction & History of Javascript

Javascript is a high level single threaded dynamically written programming / scripting language that enables the user to implement complex features in a static web page. Primarily Javascript is a client side programming language which allows the client to trigger some specific actions and events according to which the browser will execte the Javascript. However Javascript has made its way into server side programming with the help of the "Node" which is a Javascript runtime based on Google Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine.

Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, the sole purpose of Javascript was to provide clients with proper functioning web pages and more dynamic scope of internet. Initially Javascript was initially known as ECMAScript (ECMA = European Computer Manufactures Association) and was developed to work on the Netscape Navigator. In 1997, a more proper implementation of Javascript was released under the name ES1 and would work with the latest Internet Explorer. Constantly undergoing development, the modern Javascript has reached ES6 in 2018 supporting almost all modern browsers. ES7 includes frameworks such as Angular, React, Redux, Vue, Svelte, etc.
